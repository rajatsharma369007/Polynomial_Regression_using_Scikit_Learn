# Polynomial Regression using Scikit Learn

## Introduction
In polynomial regression, the relationship between independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. It is used when the input data has some pattern resembling a curve. In this notebook, I have used sklearn's PolynomialFeatures to extend the predictor feature column into multiple columns.

## Dataset
Have a look at the input features and labels. [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Polynomial_Regression_using_Scikit_Learn/blob/master/data.csv)

## Sklearn library
<code> from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression </code>  
<code> from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures </code>

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
